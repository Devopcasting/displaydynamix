- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean, modern interface.
- Accent color: Electric Purple (#8E24AA) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif for a modern, machined, objective look, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use a set of modern, minimalist icons that are clear and intuitive. Icons should be consistent throughout the application to maintain a cohesive look and feel.
- A clean, grid-based layout will provide structure and clarity. Utilize white space effectively to avoid clutter and enhance readability. Prioritize key functions in prominent areas of the screen.
- Subtle animations to provide feedback and enhance user experience, such as smooth transitions, loading indicators, and interactive cues. Animations should be purposeful and not distracting.
